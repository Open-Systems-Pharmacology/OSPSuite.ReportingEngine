# Development tasks

## dev_mode

  `devtools::dev_mode` function switches your version of R into "development mode". This is useful to avoid clobbering the existing versions of CRAN packages that you need for other tasks. Calling dev_mode() again will turn development mode off, and return you to your default library setup.

```R
# This will install the package in the folder C:/Rpackages
devtools::dev_mode(path="C:/Rpackages")
```

## Reload the package

```R
devtools::load_all()
```

or `Ctrl + Shift + L`

## Add or update script files

  `.R` files defined in `tests\dev\` will be removed from the package and can be used to simulate interaction with the package. See [scripts.R](tests/dev/scripts.R)
