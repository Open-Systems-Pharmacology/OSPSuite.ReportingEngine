This vignette introduces the notions and objects implemented in the OSP-Suite Reporting Engine package (`ospsuite.reportingengine`).

# Introduction

The `ospsuite.reportingengine` package aims at facilitating the design and build of reports evaluating PBPK models developed on PK-Sim or/and Mobi.

To this end, the package benefits from the concept of R6 classes (similar to reference classes) which allows to define structured objects whose fields can be any object such as properties, methods or even other R6 objects.
R6 objects, or objects from R6 class, presents some peculiarities.

- They are created using the method `$new(...)` (e.g. `r6Object <- R6Class$new()`).
- Like for objects of class list, fields of R6 objects can be called using either `$fieldName` or `[[fieldName]]` (e.g. `r6Object$method()` or `r6Object[[property]]`).
- The R6 classes also integrate the concept of inheritance: an R6 object will get the attributes from its class but will also inherit properties and methods from a parent class.

The `ospsuite.reportingengine` package is built around two central R6 classes __`MeanModelWorkflow`__ and __`PopulationWorkflow`__ derived from the parent R6 class `Workflow`.
The creation of `MeanModelWorkflow` or `PopulationWorkflow` objects provides a structured environment with methods and properties that help in designing, running and reporting the evaluation of PBPK models developed on PK-Sim or/and Mobi.
Such structured environment works with 2 types of objects:

- `SimulationSet` R6 objects and their `Output` R6 objects (defined in more details in section __3__), defining on which model(s) and/or data the workflow is performed. These objects need to be created before the creation of workflow objects as they are required by them.
- `Task` R6 objects (defined in more details in section __4__), defining the settings of the evaluations to be performed by the workflow. These objects are directly included upon creation of `Workflow` objects. Their settings can be updated after creation.

## Nomenclature

Table 1 defines some of the main instances of the `ospsuite.reportingengine` package usually defined by users during the design of a workflow. The classes of these instances and the parent classes they are derived from are also indicated.
All these instances derive from the `R6` class, consequently creating them requires the call of the method `$new()` (e.g. `MeanModelWorkflow$new()`)

```{r table 1, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}

## General scheme

A working example of workflow script is provided below for reporting a time profile plot on *Minimodel2.pkml*.

```{r general scheme, warning=FALSE, results='hide',message=FALSE}
# Get the pkml simulation file: "MiniModel2.pkml"
simulationFile <- system.file("extdata", "MiniModel2.pkml",
  package = "ospsuite.reportingengine"
)

# Create Output objects which define output paths that will be plotted by the workflow
outputA <- Output$new(
  path = "Organism|A|Concentration in container",
  displayName = "Concentration of A"
)
outputB <- Output$new(
  path = "Organism|B|Concentration in container",
  displayName = "Concentration of B"
)

# Create a SimulationSet object which defines the model and outputs to evaluate
myExampleSet <- SimulationSet$new(
  simulationSetName = "My example",
  simulationFile = simulationFile,
  outputs = c(outputA, outputB)
)

# Create the workflow object
myExampleWorkflow <-
  MeanModelWorkflow$new(
    simulationSets = myExampleSet,
    workflowFolder = "myExample-Results"
  )

# Set the workflow tasks to be run
myExampleWorkflow$activateTasks(c("simulate", "plotTimeProfilesAndResiduals"))

# Run the workflow
myExampleWorkflow$runWorkflow()
```

For this example, the list of files and folders generated by the workflow are:
```{r general scheme files}
list.files(myExampleWorkflow$workflowFolder)
```

```{r general scheme render, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Convert the markdown document into html with specific format
rmarkdown::render(myExampleWorkflow$reportFileName)
```

The associated report will be as follows:

```{r general scheme report, echo=FALSE}
# TO DO: customize the HTML output:
# The chunk needs to get a special source tag/type to be output differently
htmltools::includeHTML(sub(".md", ".html", myExampleWorkflow$reportFileName))
```

```{r delete general scheme, inlcude = FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Remove the workflow folders
unlink(myExampleWorkflow$workflowFolder, recursive = TRUE)
```

# Workflow

`Workflow` objects are central in the Reporting Engine as they summarize which evaluations are performed and how they are reported.
As illustrated in the example from section __1.1__,  `Workflow` objects manage directly 2 other R instances: `SimulationSet` and `Task` objects.
`Workflow` objects also require an output folder, `workflowFolder` to be provided in order to be created.
This folder is where all the generated outputs will be saved and stored.

`Task` objects are R instances that correspond to the evaluations, plots and tables to be performed, saved and/or reported (see section XXX for more details on `Task`).
Each active `Task` will be performed on a series of `SimulationSet` objects.

`SimulationSet` objects are R objects that summarize the workflow input parameters, they include the model(s) to be evaluated (see section __3__ for more details on `SimulationSet`).
A `SimulationSet` can optionally include observed data and a population file.

In the `ospsuite.reportingengine` package, two types of `Workflow` are available and can be created:

1) `MeanModelWorkflow` dedicated on evaluations specific to mean models
2) `PopulationWorkflow` dedicated on evaluations specific to population models

## MeanModelWorkflow

The process included in `MeanModelWorkflow` can be illustrated by Figure 1.

The blue frame corresponds to the inputs of the workflow. 
These inputs need to be defined through the R object `SimulationSet`.
Since multiple simulations and observed datasets can be evaluated by the workflow tasks, it is possible to define a list of such inputs by workflow.

The black frames correspond to the tasks of the workflow. 
These tasks are defined through the R object `Task`.
These objects do not have to be instantiated by the user; they are created directly by the `Workflow` object.
The user will only have to switch them on/off and update their settings if necessary.

```{r figure 1, out.width="100%", include=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap= "Figure 1: Mean model workflow inputs and tasks", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(system.file("extdata", "mean-model-workflow-input-and-tasks.png", package = "ospsuite.reportingengine"))
```

## PopulationWorkflow

The process included in `PopulationWorkflow` can be illustrated by Figure 2.

The blue frame corresponds to the inputs of the workflow. 
These inputs need to be defined through the R object `PopulationSimulationSet`.
Since multiple simulations, population and observed datasets can be evaluated by the workflow tasks, it is possible to define a list of such inputs by workflow.

The black frames correspond to the tasks of the workflow. 
These tasks are defined through the R object `Task`.
These objects do not have to be instantiated by the user; they are created directly by the `Workflow` object.
The user will only have to switch them on/off and update their settings if necessary.

In a population workflow, some tasks can compare different simulations or population, such plots of Demography or PK parameters.
There exist different types of a population workflow

1) __Pediatric__
   - All properties (physiology and PK Parameter) are plotted vs. age and weight,
   - The time profiles are plotted in comparison to a reference population the sensitivity analysis is done on all populations except the reference population
2) __Parallel Comparison__
   - PK parameter are plotted parallel in Box-Whisker plots without a reference population,
   - If a reference population is given, the time profiles are plotted in comparison to this population
   - The sensitivity analysis is done on all populations
3) __Ratio Comparison__
   - Same as parallel comparison, but for the PK Parameter additional the ratio of the PK Parameter to the reference population is calculated and plotted in box-whisker plots 


```{r figure 2, out.width="100%", include=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap= "Figure 2: Population workflow inputs and tasks", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(system.file("extdata", "population-workflow-input-and-tasks.png", package = "ospsuite.reportingengine"))
```

## Creation of a Workflow

To create a `MeanModelWorkflow` or a `PopulationWorkflow` object, the method `$new()` needs to be used as follow:

- For mean model workflows: 
```
myWorkflow <- MeanModelWorkflow$new(simulationSets, workflowFolder)
```
- For population workflows: 
```
myWorkflow <- 
PopulationWorkflow$new(workflowType, simulationSets, workflowFolder)
```

where `simulationSets` is a list of `SimulationSet` objects for mean models, and a list of `PopulationSimulationSet` objects for population models.
These objects will be further discussed in the next section.

`workflowFolder` is the name of the folder in which the workflow outputs are saved.
As illustrated in Figures 1 and 2, some tasks can use the outputs obtained from previous tasks.
If the directory specified in `workflowFolder` contains such outputs, they will be used by the current workflow.
This latter option can be useful for updating and running only a part of the workflow without having to perform all the simulations every time.

The input `workflowType` is one of the 3 population workflow types defined in section __2.2__.

# Simulation sets

As workflows can evaluate multiple simulations, populations and datasets, 
the creation of `MeanModelWorkflow` and `PopulationWorkflow` requires input parameters summarized in `SimulationSet` and `PopulationSimulationSet` objects, respectively.

Below is the syntax for creating such simulation sets, the next sub-sections will provide more details on each input:

__Simulation Set__
```
SimulationSet$new(
  simulationSetName, 
  simulationFile, 
  simulationName, 
  outputs,
  observedDataFile,
  observedMetaDataFile,
  dataReportName,
  dataSelection
)
```

__Population Simulation Set__
```
PopulationSimulationSet$new(
  referencePopulation,
  simulationSetName, 
  simulationFile, 
  simulationName,
  populationFile,
  populationName,
  studyDesignFile, 
  outputs, 
  observedDataFile,
  observedMetaDataFile,
  dataReportName,
  dataSelection
)
```

## Simulation file

A simulation file, `simulationFile` is an export of a simulation from MoBi or PK-SIM in pkml format.
Display names for the simulation and the simulation set can be provided using `simulationName` and `simulationSetName`.

## Population file

A population file, `populationFile`, is collection of parameter paths and parameter values normally an export of a population from PK-SIM in csv format.
It is also possible to use an M&S activity-specific population file, which has the “PKSIM” format, but was manipulated after the export from PK-SIM or was generated outside of PK-Sim. The generation of the population file than must be validated.
Display names for the population can be provided using `populationName`.

### Study Design file

The study design file, `studyDesignFile`, contains additional information on the study design, e.g. a body weight dependent dose in a pediatric study.
A regular csv format is expected for such a file.

The example below shows a template of such a study design content.

```{r study design file, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
studyDesignFile <- system.file("extdata", "StudyDesign.csv", package = "ospsuite.reportingengine")
exampleStudyDesign <- readObservedDataFile(studyDesignFile)
```

```{r table 2, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(exampleStudyDesign, caption = "Table 2: Example of study design content")
```

## Format of data files

__If your workflow uses data, you must provide two files__:
one file containing the data in the Nonmem format, `observedDataFile`, and a dictionary file, `observedMetaDataFile`, which documents the content of the data file.
Display names for the data can be provided using `dataReportName`.

### Data file

The Nonmem file can be a blank separated text file or a csv file, column headers are used later as R variable names, and they must not contain special letters like blanks.
All data columns used for figures and tables, must be numerical and listed in the dictionary file (details in section __3.3.2__).
For data filtering, these columns and additional ones can be used, the additional columns may also contain strings. 
But be careful that these strings do not contain the column separator blank. 
A column must be either numerical or of type string, they must not contain both. 

### Dictionary file

```{r dictionary file, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
dictionaryFile <- system.file("extdata", "tpDictionary.csv", package = "ospsuite.reportingengine")
exampleDictionary <- readObservedDataFile(dictionaryFile)
```

The dictionary is a csv file mapping the data file.
Unlike the Matlab version of the reporting engine, a regular csv with a comma (",") as separator is expected.

The dictionary file must contain the following variables: `r paste0("'", paste0(names(exampleDictionary), collapse = "', '"), "'")`.
For time profile plots, you must provide '__time__' and '__dv__' in '__ID__'. 
The variable '__lloq__', for lower limit of quantitation, can also be provided but is not necessary.

The example below shows a template of a dictionary content.

```{r table 3, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(exampleDictionary, caption = "Table 3: Template for data dictionary")
```

## Outputs

An `Output` object defines simulation paths and can define associated PK parameters and observed data.
Below is the syntax for creating such `Output` objects, the next sub-sections will provide more details on each input:

__Output__
```
Output$new(
  path,
  displayName,
  displayUnit,
  dataSelection,
  dataDisplayName,
  pkParameters
)
```

### Path

The input variable `path` indicates the path name within a simulation (e.g. '*Organism|PeripheralVenousBlood|Raltegravir|Plasma (Peripheral Venous Blood)*') that needs to be included in the simulation run.
Display name and unit for this path can be provided using `displayName` and `displayUnit`.

### Data selection

For tasks such as goodness of fit, observed data can be used.
Usually, the data is included into one unique Nonmem data file which needs to be filtered and associated to the correct `path`.

The input variable `dataSelection` provides a filter for the Nonmem data file.
It must be R readable code, using the Nonmem headers as variable names (e.g. '*SID>0*' or '*AGE<12 & SEX==1*').

- By default, `dataSelection` = '__NONE__'. Consequently, no data is selected and no evaluation is performed.
- If you want to use all, you can include the filter `dataSelection` = '__ALL__'.

### PK parameters

The input `pkParameters` indicates the `path` related PK parameters that the user wants to include in his analysis.
A list of pk parameter names can be directly provided to this input (e.g. *c('C_max', 'AUC_inf')*).
Display names and display units will be used as is from the PK parameter objects defined using the `ospsuite` package.

In the case different display names or/and units are needed between the same PK parameters but from different paths, it is also possible to use `PkParameterInfo` instances instead of pk parameter names directly.
```
PkParameterInfo$new(
  pkParameter,
  displayName, 
  displayUnit
)
```

However, in the case the same display names and units are used, 
the better practice is to define or update the PK parameters, their display names and units beforehand with the `ospsuite` package,
then to provide directly the list of their names to the input `pkParameters`.

- Updating PK parameters, their display names and units can be done directly with: __updatePKParameter()__.
- Users can also create their own PK parameters using: __addUserDefinedPKParameter()__.

# Task objects

As illustrated in Figures 1 and 2, workflows can perform tasks on a list of simulation sets.
Some of these tasks are not necessarily run or can use the output results from other tasks run in previous workflows.

You can use the enums `StandardSimulationTasks` and `StandardPlotTasks` respectively to get a quick access to standard simulation and plot tasks common to mean model and population workflows.

When they are created, `Workflow` objects will directly include a list of `Task` objects.
To know which tasks your workflow can perform, the workflow method __getAllTasks()__ can be used. 
The workflow methods __getActiveTasks()__ and __getInactiveTasks()__ provide the list of active and inactive tasks of the workflow, respectively.

Using the example from section __1.1__, this gives on a mean model workflow:
```{r mean model tasks}
# All workflow's tasks
myExampleWorkflow$getAllTasks()

# Only active tasks that are run
myExampleWorkflow$getActiveTasks()

# Only inactive tasks that are not run
myExampleWorkflow$getInactiveTasks()
```

To activate or inactivate tasks, you can use respectively the workflow methods __activateTasks()__ and __inactivateTasks()__. 
By default, all the tasks will be activated or inactivated when using the method.

```{r mean model activate tasks}
# Inactivate all tasks
myExampleWorkflow$inactivateTasks()
myExampleWorkflow$getActiveTasks()

# Activate only tasks "simulate" and "plotGoF" tasks
myExampleWorkflow$activateTasks(c("simulate", "plotTimeProfilesAndResiduals"))
myExampleWorkflow$getActiveTasks()
```

It is possible to modify the settings of the tasks, especially for tasks generating figures 
(e.g. plot scales, inclusion of specific demography parameters ...)
Task details will be provided in dedicated vignettes.

# Workflow outputs

Once the workflow and its settings have been defined, the workflow method __$runWorkflow()__ will run all the active tasks and generate all the associated results and report.
The following outputs will be generated in `workflowFolder` directory: logs, results directories and reports.

## Logs
 
Three types of logs can be generated during the creation, design and run of a workflow: 
 
- __log-info.txt__ which contains information like starting time and version numbers of the used software
- __log-error.txt__ which contains all errors and warnings that occurred during the execution
- __log-debug.txt__ which contains information useful for debugging purpose.

## Result directories

Each task will save its results in a dedicated directory. 
The names of the results directory are as follow:

- __SimulationResults__ which contains the results of simulation runs, obtained from `simulate` task, as csv files.
It is possible to load the results using the `ospsuite` method __importResultsFromCSV()__.
- __PKAnalysisResults__ which contains the results of PK analysis runs, obtained from `calculatePKParameters` task, as csv files.
It is possible to load the results using the `ospsuite` method __importPKAnalysesFromCSV()__.
- __SensitivityResults__ which contains the results of sensitivity analysis runs, obtained from `calculateSensitivity` task, as csv files.
It is possible to load the results using the `ospsuite` method __importSensitivityAnalysisResultsFromCSV()__.
- __TimeProfiles__ which contains the figures obtained from `plotTimeProfilesAndResiduals` task and their source values as png and csv files.
- __PKAnalysis__ which contains the figures and tables obtained from `plotPKParameters` task and their source values as png and csv files.
- __Sensitivity__ which contains the figures obtained from `plotSensitivity` task and their source values as png and csv files.
- __MassBalance__ which contains the figures and tables obtained from `plotMassBalance` task and their source values as png and csv files.
This directory is specific of mean model workflows.
- __Absorption__ which contains the figures and tables obtained from `plotAbsorption` task and their source values as png and csv files. 
This directory is specific of mean model workflows.
- __Demography__ which contains the figures and tables obtained from `plotDemography` task and their source values as png and csv files.
This directory is specific of population model workflows.

Default figure format is png, but it is possible to change this default using __setPlotFormat()__.

## Reports and appendices

Each plot task will save an appendix file besides its results as a markdown format report.
These appendices are saved directly within the `workflowFolder` directory results directory with the following names:

- __appendix-time-profile.md__ from `plotTimeProfilesAndResiduals` task.
- __appendix-pk-parameters.md__ from `plotPKParameters` task.
- __appendix-sensitivity-analysis.md__ from `plotSensitivity` task.
- __appendix-mass-balance.md__ from `plotMassBalance` task.
- __appendix-absorption.md__ from `plotAbsorption` task.
- __appendix-demography.md__ from `plotDemography` task.

At the end of the workflow run, all the available appendices are combined into final reports:

- __Report.md__ which contains the markdown version of the report, including a table of content and numbering the figures and tables.
- __Report-word.md__ which contains a markdown version of the report to be translated by *pandoc* for generating the word report.
- __Report.docx__ which contains the word version of the report, including a table of content and numbering the figures and tables.

The option `createWordReport` is set to __TRUE__ as default but can be set to __FALSE__ to prevent the conversion of __Report-word.md__ into __Report.docx__ using *pandoc* .
