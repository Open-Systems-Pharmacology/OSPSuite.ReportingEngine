# Overview

This vignette provides some guidance to define and set plot properties for the reporting engine.

Plot configuration can be set at 2 levels:

- Global or workflow plot configuration, affecting every plot of the workflow output
- Local or task plot configuration, affecting specific plots within a task


# How to set global workflow properties

Most of the global settings can be managed using the notion of __theme__ from the `tlf` package,
the `reporting.engine` functions generate their plots using the `tlf` package.

Some shortkey methods were added to the `reporting.engine` package to simplify their use.

## Notion of theme

A theme is an object of R6 class `Theme` which defines the default properties used to build every plot in `tlf` package.
More information can be found direcctly within the documentation of the the `tlf` package (vignettes __"theme"__ and __"plot-configuration"__).

The best workflow to set a `Theme` object is to use json files.
Templates of json files are available in the `tlf` package at the location defined below:

```{r theme definition}
# Get the path of the Json template
jsonFile <- system.file("extdata", "template-theme.json", 
                        package = "tlf")

# Load the theme from the json file
reTheme <- tlf::loadThemeFromJson(jsonFile)
```

Modifications of the theme properties can be done directly by updating the properties of the `Theme` object as shown below:
```{r theme modifications}
# Overwrite the current background fill
reTheme$background$panel$fill <- "white"
reTheme$background$panel$fill
```

To save the updated `Theme` object, the function `saveThemeToJson` provided by `tlf` package can be used.
```{r theme save}
# Save your updated theme in "my-new-theme.json"
tlf::saveThemeToJson("my-new-theme.json", theme = reTheme)
```

In addition, the `tlf` package provides a Shiny app to define and save your own theme with a few clicks: __`tlf::runThemeMaker()`__.

Then, the most important step is then to define the `Theme` object as the current default for the workflow.
The example below set the __`reTheme`__ `Theme` object as current default. 
As a consequence, the properties defined by the object will be used if no specific plot configurations are provided for the workflow plots.

```{r current theme}
# Set reTheme as current default Theme
useTheme(reTheme)
```

## Exporting plots in a specific format

One important global setting is the format of the figure files (e.g. png, jpg or pdf) as well as the quality of the figures.
By default, the figures are saved as png files with a size of 20 x 15 cm.
The format settings can be managed using the function __`setPlotFormat(format)`__ as illustrated below, input arguments `width`, `height` and `units` can also be defined.

```{r set plot format}
setPlotFormat("png")
```

## Watermark

Watermark corresponds to text in the background of plots.
Watermark font properties can be set in the `Theme` object: `reTheme$fonts$watermark`.

Regarding the content of the watermark, the default content available in the `Theme` object (i.e. at `reTheme$background$watermark` in the example) is overwritten by the `Workflow` objects:

- If a system is validated, no text is printed in background by default.
- If a system is __NOT__ validated, the text __*"preliminary results"*__ is printed in background by default.

As a consequence, setting the watermark content needs to be performed directly with the `Workflow` objects:
either when initializing the workflow using the input argument `watermark` (e.g. `MeanModelWorkflow$new(..., watermark = "vignette example")`); or using the workflow method __`$setWatermark(watermark)`__ (e.g. `myWorkflow$setWatermark("vignette example")`).

The workflow method __`$getWatermark()`__ prints the watermark text which will be in the background of the figures output by the workflow (e.g. `myWorkflow$getWatermark()`).

__Note__: The __NULL__ input argument for watermark leads to using the default watermark feature.

# How to set task specific properties

Each task of `Workflow` objects includes a field named __`settings`__.
This optional field of class `TaskSettings` can be updated and will overwrite the default behavior of a task.

Two usual subfields of __`settings`__ are: __`plotConfigurations`__ and __`bins`__.
Other settings can also be provided and will be detailed in the next sections.

- __`plotConfigurations`__ is a list of `PlotConfiguration` objects from the `tlf` package.
`PlotConfiguration` is an R6 class in which plot properties are stored and used to create plots with a desired configuration.
More information can be found on this notion within the `tlf` vignette __"plot-configuration"__.
Providing a user-defined `PlotConfiguration` object to this input list will overwrite the default configuration and will be used to generate the task corresponding task plot(s).
- __`bins`__ can be a number, a vector or a function which will be used to bin histograms.

The next section will provide the names of the plots and options that can be accessed through the field __`settings`__.

## Time profiles and residuals

Regardless of the workflow subclass (`MeanModelWorkflow` or `PopulationWorkflow`), 
the names in the __`plotConfigurations`__ list available for the __"plotTimeProfilesAndResiduals"__ task are the following:

- __"timeProfile"__: for time profile plots in linear and log scale
- __"obsVsPred"__: for observed vs simulated data in linear and log scale
- __"resVsPred"__: for residuals vs simulated data plots
- __"resVsTime"__: for residuals vs time plots
- __"resHisto"__: for histograms of residuals
- __"resQQPlot"__: for qq-plots of residuals
- __"histogram"__: for histograms of residuals across all simulations
- __"qqPlot"__: for qq-plots of residuals across all simulations

Since histograms are performed by the task, __`bins`__ can also be defined.

Displayed names and units are usually managed through the __`SimulationSet`__ and __`Output`__ objects. 
The vignette __"goodness-of-fit"__ provides more details about the __"plotTimeProfilesAndResiduals"__ task.

__Example__: below shows a typical mean model workflow example in which __`plotConfigurations`__ and __`bins`__ are set for a __"plotTimeProfilesAndResiduals"__ task.

```{r example time profile}
# Get the pkml simulation file: "MiniModel2.pkml"
simulationFile <- system.file("extdata", "MiniModel2.pkml",
  package = "ospsuite.reportingengine"
)

# Get the observation file and its dictionary
observationFile <- system.file("extdata", "SimpleData.nmdat",
  package = "ospsuite.reportingengine"
)
dictionaryFile <- system.file("extdata", "tpDictionary.csv",
  package = "ospsuite.reportingengine"
)

# Define the output object
outputA <- Output$new(
  path = "Organism|A|Concentration in container",
  displayName = "Simulated concentration of A",
  displayUnit = "µmol/ml",
  dataSelection = "MDV==0",
  dataDisplayName = "Observed concentration of A"
)

# Define the simulation set object
setA <- SimulationSet$new(
  simulationSetName = "A",
  simulationFile = simulationFile,
  outputs = outputA,
  observedDataFile = observationFile,
  observedMetaDataFile = dictionaryFile
)

# Create the workflow object
workflowA <-
  MeanModelWorkflow$new(
    simulationSets = setA,
    workflowFolder = "Example-A"
  )

# Set the workflow tasks to be run
workflowA$activateTasks(c("simulate", "plotTimeProfilesAndResiduals"))
```

The next chunk of code will define `PlotConfiguration` objects to be included in __`settings`__:

```{r example create time profile configurations}
# Define plot configuration for obsVsPred
obsVsPredConfiguration <- PlotConfiguration$new(
  xlabel = "Observed values [µmol/ml]",
  ylabel = "Simulated values [µmol/ml]",
  watermark = "vignette")

# Define plot configuration for resHisto
resHistoConfiguration <- PlotConfiguration$new(
  xlabel = "Residuals",
  ylabel = "Count",
  watermark = "vignette")

# Update some fields of the configuration if necessary
resHistoConfiguration$background$plot$fill <- "lemonchiffon"
resHistoConfiguration$background$panel$fill <- "lemonchiffon"
resHistoConfiguration$background$panel$color <- "goldenrod3"
resHistoConfiguration$background$xGrid$color <- "goldenrod3"
resHistoConfiguration$background$yGrid$color <- "goldenrod3"

# Define plotConfigurations list
plotConfigurations <- list(resHisto = resHistoConfiguration,
                           obsVsPred = obsVsPredConfiguration)

# Define list to update task settings with plotConfigurations field and and bins field  
mySettings <- list(plotConfigurations = plotConfigurations, 
                   bins = 3)
```

Then, the __`settings`__ field of the __"plotTimeProfilesAndResiduals"__ task can be updated as shown below:

```{r example set time profile configurations}
# Run the workflow
workflowA$plotTimeProfilesAndResiduals$settings <- mySettings
```

__Note__: currently the settings can be updated directly allocating the list.
However, this method may lead to errors if the settings are not correctly defined.
Relevant methods and `TaskSettings` class will replace this process which may become deprecated in later versions.

The run of the workflow with updated settings and get the resulting report as shown below.

Since the histogram across the all simulations did not get the plot configuration settings defined for individual simulations, the plots are quite different.
However, the option __`bins`__ is currently set among all plots of the task.
Regarding observed vs simulated plots, the got the updated xlabel, ylabel and watermark as defined in the plot configuration.

```{r example run time profile}
# Run the workflow
workflowA$runWorkflow()
```

```{r example render time profile, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Convert the markdown document into html
# Otherwise the root path is messed up and cannot print the report correctly
rmarkdown::render(workflowA$reportFileName)
```

<div class = "reportOutput">
```{r example time profile report, echo=FALSE}
htmltools::includeHTML(sub(".md", ".html", workflowA$reportFileName))
```
</div>

```{r delete example time profile, inlcude = FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Remove the workflow folders
unlink(workflowA$workflowFolder, recursive = TRUE)
```


## PK parameters plots

Selection, displayed names and units are usually managed through the `ospsuite` __`PKParameters`__ objects or __`PkParametersInfo`__ objects. 
The vignette __"pk-parameters"__ provides more details about the __"plotPKParameters"__ task.

For mean model workflows, the PK parameters are only summarized as tables.
In the current version, there is no option for number of decimal numbers to set.

For population workflows, the parameters are described using plots which depends on the population workflow type.
The names in the __`plotConfigurations`__ list available for the __"plotPKParameters"__ task are the following:

- __"boxplotPkParameters"__: for boxplots of PK parameters performed by parallel comparison and ratio types of population workflows
- __"boxplotPkRatios"__: for boxplots of PK parameters ratios performed by ratio type of population workflows
- __"vpcParameterPlot"__: for VPC like plots of PK parameters vs Demography parameters performed by pediatric type of population workflows
- __"comparisonVpcPlot"__: for VPC like plots of PK parameters vs Demography parameters comparing to reference population performed by pediatric type

Since pediatric workflows perform VPC like plot, aggregation of the data is performed along the demography parameters.
The binning of the demography parameters can be set by the optional field __`bins`__ from the task field __`settings`__.
This field can be either a unique value corresponding to the number of bins or a vector defining the bin edges for all the demography parameter paths.

Besides, the final plot can either link the aggregated values or plot them as stairstep. 
The default behaviour is to perform a stairstep plot, but this can be tuned with the optional field __`stairstep`__ (`TRUE`/`FALSE`) from the task field __`settings`__.

Below shows examples of how to set such options:

```{r PK parameter settings}
# Associate the bin edges
workflowA$plotPKParameters$settings$bins <- c(0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10)

# Associate the number of bins
workflowA$plotPKParameters$settings$bins <- 15

# Set VPC as stair step 
workflowA$plotPKParameters$settings$stairstep <- TRUE
```

## Sensitivity plots

Settings for the sensitivity plots are currently the only settings managed by R6 objects.
To define settings, it is consequently necessary to create __`SensitivityPlotSettings`__ objects.
The vignette __"sensitivity-analysis"__ provides more details about the __"plotSensitivity"__ task.

The input argument of the __`SensitivityPlotSettings`__ settings object are then (to be created using `SensitivityPlotSettings$new()`): 

- __`totalSensitivityThreshold`__: cut-off used for plots of the most sensitive parameters; default is __0.9__.
- __`variableParameterPaths`__: paths that were varied in the sensitivity analysis.
If supplied __`totalSensitivityThreshold`__ is 1, else it uses the default or user-provided value.
- __`maximalParametersPerSensitivityPlot`__: maximal number of parameters to display in a sensitivity plot.
By default, the maximal number of parameters to display is __50__.
- __`plotConfiguration`__: `PlotConfiguration` object from `tlf` library
- __`xAxisFontSize`__: Font size of x-axis labels for sensitivity plot, that can overwrite behavior of __`plotConfiguration`__.
Default font size is 6.
- __`yAxisFontSize`__: Font size of y-axis labels for sensitivity plot, that can overwrite behavior of __`plotConfiguration`__.
Default font size is 6.
- __`xLabel`__ Label of x-axis for sensitivity plot, that can overwrite behavior of __`plotConfiguration`__.
Default xLabel is __"Sensitivity"__.
- __`yLabel`__ Label of y-axis for sensitivity plot, that can overwrite behavior of __`plotConfiguration`__.
Default yLabel is __NULL__.
- __`colorPalette`__ Name of a color palette to be used by `ggplot2::scale_fill_brewer()` for sensitivity plot.
Default color palette is __"Spectral"__.

## Absorption

The name in the __`plotConfigurations`__ list available for the __"plotAbsorption"__ task is the following:

- __"absorptionPlot"__

## Mass Balance

The name in the __`plotConfigurations`__ list available for the __"plotMassBalance"__ task is the following:

- __"timeProfile"__: for time profile plots of mass balance in linear and log scales
- __"cumulativeTimeProfile"__: for cumulative time profile plots of mass balance in linear and log scales
- __"normalizedTimeProfile"__: for normalized time profile plots (as fraction of drug mass) of mass balance in linear and log scales
- __"normalizedCumulativeTimeProfile"__: for cumulative normalized time profile plots of mass balance in linear and log scales
- __"pieChart"__: for pie chart of mass balance at last simulated time point

Another field of __`settings`__ is __`selectedCompoundNames`__ which allows to keep only a selected list of compounds to be kept in the mass balance plots.

## Demography plots

The names in the __`plotConfigurations`__ list available for the __"plotDemography"__ task are the following:

- __"histogram"__: for histogram of Demography parameters performed by parallel comparison and ratio types of population workflows
- __"vpcParameterPlot"__: for VPC like plots of Demography parameters vs Demography parameters performed by pediatric type of population workflows
- __"comparisonVpcPlot"__: for VPC like plots of Demography parameters vs Demography parameters comparing to reference population performed by pediatric type

Since pediatric workflows perform VPC like plot, aggregation of the data is performed along the demography parameters.
The binning of the demography parameters can be set by the optional field __`bins`__ from the task field __`settings`__.
This field can be either a unique value corresponding to the number of bins or a vector defining the bin edges for all the demography parameter paths.

Besides, the final plot can either link the aggregated values or plot them as stairstep. 
The default behaviour is to perform a stairstep plot, but this can be tuned with the optional field __`stairstep`__ (`TRUE`/`FALSE`) from the task field __`settings`__.

Similarly, parallel comparison and ratio types of population workflows perform histograms, whose binning can set using the __`settings`__ field __`bins`__.
