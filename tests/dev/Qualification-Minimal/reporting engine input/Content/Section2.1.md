Among the curiosities of human nature this legend claims a high place. 
It is needless to remind the reader that the Picts were never exterminated, 
and form to this day a large proportion of the folk of Scotland, 
occupying the eastern and the central parts, from the Firth of Forth, 
or perhaps the Lammermoors, upon the south, to the Ord of Caithness on the north. 
That the blundering guess of a dull chronicler should have inspired men 
with imaginary loathing for their own ancestors is already strange; 
that it should have begotten this wild legend seems incredible. 
Is it possible the chronicler's error was merely nominal? 
That what he told, and what the people proved themselves so ready to receive, 
about the Picts, was true or partly true of some anterior and perhaps Lappish savages, 
small of stature, black of hue, dwelling underground -- possibly also the distillers of some forgotten spirit? 
See Mr. Campbell's Tales of the West Highlands.
